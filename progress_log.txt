It is pretty much done. This is how the program should be operated:
You can upload 
+) .json files ("COVID files for testing" folder) 
+) .hihi files (This will be created by the program in order to save the current state of the 
dashboard for the current 7-day interval)
(Please, use only the files from the folder and the files created by the program)

If the you upload .json file:
The data will be displayed with 3 diagrams: Bar Chart, Column Chart and Scatter Chart.
Some calculations will be displayed in Cards. (The hovering effect is just for decorating purposes, there's nothing there)
You can choose the time interval to display as a 7-day interval by typing in the start date. 
(For example, the input start date is 1/1/2021, the end date will be calculated by the program and will be 7/1/2021)
You can choose to display, hide, duplicate the diagrams. 
You can hide-show and resize the components (The Uploader, the Diagram area, the Data table)
And finally, you can choose to save the current state of the dashboard for the current 7-day interval as ".hihi" files.

If you upload .hihi file:
Everything from .json is avaiable but 
+) The ability to choose which 7-day interval to display (Why? The content of the file itself is a 7-day interval)
+) The ability to save the current state of the dashboard (Why? The current state of the program IS the uploaded file)
These functions will not be available, as they no longer make sense.

All functions have been tested. They work as expected.
